## Hello! 👋
I'm Wilson Xia, and I'm a recent RIT Game Design & Development graduate seeking roles in game development or software engineering.

I'm Experienced in Web Development, Mobile Development, and Game Development

Here are some of the tools I used:
- Unity
- Unreal Engine
- VS Code
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- GitHub

and here are the Languages I worked with:
- C#
- C++
- HTML/CSS/Javascript + Typescript
- React
- Flutter
  
I'm currently building a small fishing game in Unity, and the repository is currently called "Fish" (i know, real creative)

I really love games, so I want to spend my life working on them as much as I do playing them!

My favorite series is the Legend of Zelda, I'm also a Pokemon Fan and I enjoy other indie series such as Hollow Knight and Terraria!

My hobbies include cooking, music, volleyball, and recently, streaming.

Please reach out to me through email: workingsonxia@gmail.com
